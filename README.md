The *Pocket Cube* (as it also called) has:

$\frac{8! \times 3^8}{3 \times 2} = 3{ }674{ }160 {\rm combinations}$

ASCII-notation allows testing and represents the 6 faces (Front, Right, Back, Left, Up, Down) with 4 cells each. 
Try solving `[o,y,y,y],[g,b,g,g],[y,o,w,w],[g,b,b,b],[o,o,w,w],[r,r,r,r]` which looks as follows:
