# mitzi-mini-rubik
Towards a 2x2x2 Rubik's cube solver for Flipper Zero. For now, there is only an HTML-version `solver.htm` which is not yet working.

The *Pocket Cube* (as it also called) has:

$\frac{8! \times 3^8}{3 \times 2} = 3{ }674{ }160 {\rm combinations}$


## Test data
The directory `test` gives you a python script which allows to generate test data (scramble the cube), execute moves for a given initial configuration, as well as solve a given string.
